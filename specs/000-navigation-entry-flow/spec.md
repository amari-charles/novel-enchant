# Feature Specification: Unified Navigation System

**Feature Branch**: `000-navigation-entry-flow`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Navigation structure that unifies reading, enhancing, and publishing into one product, supporting both reader-driven (Enhance-first) and author-driven (Explore-first) modes"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Description parsed: Navigation system with phase-dependent behavior
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: readers, authors, enhanced copies, published works, bookmarks, phase transitions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All aspects clearly defined in requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flows defined for both logged-out and logged-in states
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Requirements FR-001 through FR-012 generated
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Enhanced Copies, Bookmarks, Drafts, Published Works identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of Novel Enchant, I need clear navigation that allows me to discover published stories, manage my enhanced reading copies, and author my own works, with the navigation adapting as the platform evolves from reader-focused to discovery-focused.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-out visitor in early phase, **When** I visit the site, **Then** I see Explore page with "Coming Soon" message and CTAs for "Enhance a Story" and "Upload a Story"
2. **Given** I am a logged-in user in early phase, **When** I log in, **Then** I am directed to My Shelf by default
3. **Given** I am a logged-in user after explore_default_enabled is set, **When** I log in, **Then** I am directed to Explore by default
4. **Given** I am on My Shelf with no content, **When** I view the page, **Then** I see "Enhance a story or bookmark one to add it here" with "Enhance a Story" CTA
5. **Given** I am on My Works with no content, **When** I view the page, **Then** I see "Upload your story to start publishing" empty state
6. **Given** I am an author on My Works, **When** I have a plain text draft, **Then** I can publish it without enhancement
7. **Given** I am on any main navigation page, **When** I look for enhancement options, **Then** I can access the Enhance action

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user bookmarks a story that gets unpublished?
- How does system handle transition when explore_default_enabled is toggled mid-session?
- What happens if a user has enhanced copies but deletes their account and re-registers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a navigation bar with four items: Explore | My Shelf | My Works | Profile for all logged-in users
- **FR-002**: System MUST show Explore page from day one, displaying "Coming Soon" in early phase with specified copy
- **FR-003**: System MUST display two CTAs on early-phase Explore: "Enhance a Story" and "Upload a Story"
- **FR-004**: System MUST route logged-in users to My Shelf by default until explore_default_enabled configuration is true
- **FR-005**: System MUST display Enhanced Copies and Bookmarks sections on My Shelf
- **FR-006**: System MUST show empty state "Enhance a story or bookmark one to add it here" when My Shelf is empty
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow authors to upload and manage Drafts and Published works in My Works
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow publishing of plain-text stories without requiring enhancement
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide "Enhance This Story" as secondary CTA in My Works for optional enhancement
- **FR-010**: System MUST make Enhance action discoverable from Explore, My Shelf, and My Works pages
- **FR-011**: System MUST support configuration-only switch from My Shelf default to Explore default without code changes
- **FR-012**: System MUST externalize all copy strings for "Coming Soon" and empty states in configurable format

### Key Entities
- **Enhanced Copy**: Reader's personal enhanced version of a story with visuals, private to user
- **Bookmark**: Reference to a published story saved to user's shelf for later reading
- **Draft**: Author's unpublished story, can be plain text or enhanced
- **Published Work**: Author's story made available in public Explore library, enhancement optional
