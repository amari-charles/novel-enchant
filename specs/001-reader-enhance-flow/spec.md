# Feature Specification: Reader Enhance (My Shelf Entry Only)

**Feature Branch**: `001-reader-enhance-flow`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Readers need a simple, automated way to turn a text story into an illustrated version and keep it private in My Shelf"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description parsed: Reader-focused enhancement flow with automated processing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: readers, text stories, automated illustration, private storage, My Shelf integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined in requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows defined for upload, enhancement, and reading
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements FR-001 through FR-015 generated
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí EnhancedCopy entity with chapters and scenes identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a reader, I want to upload or paste a text story and have it automatically enhanced with illustrations, so I can enjoy a more immersive reading experience while keeping my enhanced copies private in My Shelf.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on My Shelf with no content, **When** I click "Enhance a story to add it here", **Then** I am taken to the Reader Enhance page at /enhance
2. **Given** I am on the Reader Enhance page, **When** I paste text or upload a supported file, **Then** the system automatically detects scenes and generates images
3. **Given** scenes and images are generated, **When** I review each scene, **Then** I can Accept or Retry individual images
4. **Given** I've reviewed all scenes, **When** I click Save to My Shelf, **Then** an EnhancedCopy is created and visible in My Shelf
5. **Given** I have an EnhancedCopy in My Shelf, **When** I open it, **Then** I see a reading view with text and inline images
6. **Given** I upload an unsupported file format, **When** the system processes it, **Then** I see a clear error message
7. **Given** I'm enhancing a very long story, **When** I hit the 30-scene limit, **Then** I see a friendly message explaining the constraint

### Edge Cases
- What happens when text is empty or near-empty? ‚Üí Show message and allow cancel
- How does system handle dialogue-heavy text with low visual cues? ‚Üí Still generate images, show tip "Some scenes may be less visual"
- What happens with very long files exceeding limits? ‚Üí Warn and suggest splitting, do not crash mid-process
- How does system handle network/job failures? ‚Üí Resume from last successful scene, never lose accepted images

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST NOT display "Enhance" in the main navbar (per navigation spec)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide "Enhance a Story" entry points from My Shelf empty state and header button
- **FR-003**: System MUST support text input via paste, .txt, .md, .docx, and .pdf file uploads
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically parse text into chapters and scenes (target 3-5 scenes per 1k words)
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate exactly one image per detected scene
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to Accept or Retry individual scene images
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a global "Regenerate all" option for all images
- **FR-008**: System MUST save enhanced stories as EnhancedCopy objects in My Shelf
- **FR-009**: System MUST keep all EnhancedCopies private (not publicly accessible)
- **FR-010**: System MUST display EnhancedCopies in My Shelf with title, timestamp, and cover image (first accepted image)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a reading view at /shelf/:copyId showing text with inline images
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce limits: max 50k words input, 2MB file size, 30 scenes per copy
- **FR-013**: System MUST show friendly error messages when limits are exceeded
- **FR-014**: System MUST include alt text for all generated images in reading view
- **FR-015**: System MUST externalize all user-visible strings in a central configuration file

### Key Entities
- **EnhancedCopy**: Reader's private enhanced version of a story
  - Contains: id, owner_user_id, title, source_type (paste/file/import), created_at
  - Includes chapters array with scenes containing: scene_id, excerpt, image_url, accepted status
  - Always marked as private in v1
- **Scene**: Automatically detected story segment with associated image
  - Contains: text excerpt, generated image, acceptance status
- **Upload**: Original file storage with normalized text representation
