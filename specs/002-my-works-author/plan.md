**Branch**: `002-my-works-author` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-my-works-author/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Loaded: 35 functional requirements across 7 feature areas
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: Web application (React + TypeScript frontend exists)
   → Structure Decision: Option 2 (web application) - existing frontend/ structure
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Template constitution found, no specific violations
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check ✓
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → All technical context clear from existing codebase analysis
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
   → Creating API contracts, entity models, and integration scenarios
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check ✓
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → Ready for /tasks command (already executed - tasks.md exists)
8. STOP - Ready for implementation
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command execution includes research and design phases.

## Summary
Core authoring platform enabling authors to create multi-chapter works with AI-enhanced images, character management, and publishing capabilities. Technical approach leverages existing React + TypeScript + Supabase architecture with new feature modules for work management, chapter editing, enhancement services, and publishing workflows.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8, React 19.1 (from existing package.json)
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Vite (existing stack)
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with edge functions for AI operations
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (following existing patterns)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (responsive design)
**Project Type**: Web - React frontend with Supabase backend
**Performance Goals**: <500ms chapter editing response, <2s image generation feedback
**Constraints**: Paste-only text input, no collaboration in v1, rate limiting for AI usage
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user authoring platform, unlimited works per author, up to 50 chapters per work

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (frontend/ - backend provided by Supabase)
- Using framework directly? Yes (React hooks, Supabase client direct usage)
- Single data model? Yes (entities map directly to Supabase tables)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (no unnecessary abstraction layers)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes (feature-based modules in src/features/)
- Libraries listed: my-works (work management), character-consistency (character linking), enhancement-pipeline (AI image integration)
- CLI per library: N/A (web application)
- Library docs: Following existing CLAUDE.md pattern

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (TDD mandatory in tasks.md)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Will be enforced
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes (defined in tasks.md)
- Real dependencies used? Yes (Supabase mock for dev, real DB for integration)
- Integration tests for: New work management services, character linking, publishing flow
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test compliance verified

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (console.log with context objects)
- Frontend logs → backend? Via Supabase edge functions
- Error context sufficient? Yes (error boundaries, user feedback)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (v1 scope)
- BUILD increments on every change? Following semantic versioning
- Breaking changes handled? N/A for initial version

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (web application) - extending existing frontend/ structure with new my-works feature module

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Completed
All technical context is clear from existing codebase analysis:

1. **Tech Stack Confirmed**: React 19.1 + TypeScript 5.8 + Vite 7.0 + Supabase
2. **Architecture Pattern**: Feature-based organization in `src/features/`
3. **State Management**: React hooks + contexts (no Redux needed)
4. **Image Generation**: Existing pipeline via Supabase edge functions
5. **Testing Strategy**: Vitest + React Testing Library pattern established

**No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items** - all technology choices validated from existing implementation.

## Phase 1: Design Artifacts

### 1. Data Model
Core entities for authoring platform:
- **Work**: Author's creative project container
- **Chapter**: Text content with enhancement anchors
- **Character**: Named entities for consistency tracking
- **Enhancement**: AI-generated images with version history
- **Publication**: Publishing metadata and SEO

### 2. API Contracts
RESTful endpoints for work management:
- Work CRUD operations
- Chapter text processing
- Character management
- Enhancement generation
- Publishing workflows

### 3. Integration Scenarios
End-to-end user journeys:
- New work creation flow
- Chapter editing with auto-save
- Character linking workflow
- Publishing and analytics

## Phase 2: Task Generation Strategy
Tasks organized by TDD phases:
1. **Setup**: Feature structure, types, routing
2. **Tests First**: Component, service, integration tests (MUST FAIL before implementation)
3. **Core Implementation**: Services, components, hooks
4. **Integration**: Publishing, analytics, safety features
5. **Polish**: Performance, documentation, manual testing

Parallel execution opportunities identified for independent file modifications.

### Phase 2 Output (Pre-existing)
- ✅ `tasks.md` - 32 implementation tasks with TDD workflow

### Planning Complete
- ✅ **Ready for Implementation** - All planning artifacts complete and validated

## Complexity Tracking
**Current Complexity**: Medium
- 5 core entities with clear relationships
- Integration with existing image generation pipeline
- Publishing workflow with SEO requirements
- Analytics dashboard implementation

**Justification**: Complexity is domain-appropriate for full-featured authoring platform. No unnecessary abstractions introduced.

**Mitigation**:
- Phased implementation via TDD
- Reuse of existing patterns and services
- Feature isolation in dedicated module
