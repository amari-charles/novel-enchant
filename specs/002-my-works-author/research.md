# Research: My Works (Author) Platform

**Context**: Comprehensive authoring platform for multi-chapter works with AI enhancements
**Date**: 2025-09-26

## Technology Stack Research

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: React 19.1 + TypeScript 5.8 + Vite 7.0
**Rationale**:
- Existing codebase already implements this stack successfully
- React 19 provides excellent performance for text editing scenarios
- TypeScript ensures type safety for complex data models
- Vite offers fast development and build performance

**Alternatives considered**: Vue.js, Angular
**Rejected because**: Would require complete rewrite of existing platform

### State Management
**Decision**: React hooks + Context API (no global store)
**Rationale**:
- Existing codebase pattern works well for feature isolation
- Author workflow is primarily single-user focused
- Complex UI states handled with useReducer pattern
- Avoids Redux complexity for relatively contained feature set

**Alternatives considered**: Redux Toolkit, Zustand
**Rejected because**: Adds unnecessary complexity for isolated authoring workflows

### Text Editing & Processing
**Decision**: Controlled textarea with custom enhancement anchors
**Rationale**:
- Simple paste-only requirement doesn't need rich text editor
- Custom anchor system for image positioning
- Better performance for large chapter text
- Easier to implement autosave functionality

**Alternatives considered**: Monaco Editor, Quill, Draft.js
**Rejected because**: Over-engineered for paste-only text input requirement

### Image Generation Integration
**Decision**: Extend existing Supabase edge functions
**Rationale**:
- Platform already has working image generation pipeline
- Supabase functions handle SDXL/Stable Diffusion calls
- Existing rate limiting and error handling
- Proven scalability for image generation workloads

**Alternatives considered**: Direct AI API integration
**Rejected because**: Would duplicate existing, working infrastructure

### Character Consistency System
**Decision**: Simple linking table with image references
**Rationale**:
- v1 scope requires basic reference system only
- Character metadata stored as JSON in PostgreSQL
- Image linking via foreign keys to enhancement table
- Supports merge/rename operations efficiently

**Alternatives considered**: Graph database, embedded ML for face recognition
**Rejected because**: Far exceeds v1 requirements and complexity budget

### Publishing & SEO
**Decision**: Server-side generation of meta tags via Supabase
**Rationale**:
- SEO requires server-side rendering for meta tags
- Supabase edge functions can generate HTML with proper headers
- Existing explore page can consume published work metadata
- Slug generation follows existing URL patterns

**Alternatives considered**: Next.js SSR, separate SEO service
**Rejected because**: Would require major architecture changes

### Analytics Implementation
**Decision**: Event-based tracking with PostgreSQL aggregation
**Rationale**:
- Simple view counting doesn't require real-time analytics
- PostgreSQL can handle aggregation for dashboard queries
- Privacy-compliant session-based unique visitor counting
- Aligns with existing Supabase data layer

**Alternatives considered**: Google Analytics, specialized analytics DB
**Rejected because**: Over-engineered for basic view counting requirements

### Rate Limiting & Safety
**Decision**: Supabase RLS + edge function rate limiting
**Rationale**:
- Row Level Security provides user isolation
- Edge functions can implement per-user rate limiting
- Content filtering via prompt analysis before AI generation
- Leverages existing Supabase auth and security model

**Alternatives considered**: Redis-based rate limiting, external moderation API
**Rejected because**: Adds infrastructure complexity without clear benefits

## Architecture Patterns Research

### Feature Organization
**Decision**: Feature-based modules with service-component-hook pattern
**Rationale**:
- Existing codebase successfully uses this pattern
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual components
- Supports parallel development

**Structure**:
```
src/features/my-works/
├── components/     # UI components
├── services/       # Business logic & API calls
├── hooks/          # State management
└── types/          # TypeScript definitions
```

### Data Flow Architecture
**Decision**: Unidirectional data flow with service layer
**Rationale**:
- Services handle all Supabase interactions
- Hooks manage component state and service orchestration
- Components focus purely on UI rendering
- Clear separation enables comprehensive testing

**Flow**: User Action → Hook → Service → Supabase → Hook → Component Update

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: TDD with contract-first testing
**Rationale**:
- Ensures all functionality is testable
- Contract tests verify service interfaces
- Integration tests cover user workflows
- Unit tests for complex business logic

**Test Types**:
1. Contract tests for service interfaces
2. Integration tests for user scenarios
3. Component tests for UI behavior
4. Unit tests for validation logic

## Performance Considerations

### Text Editing Performance
**Research**: Large chapter handling (50,000+ words)
**Decision**: Debounced autosave with optimistic updates
**Rationale**:
- 500ms debounce prevents excessive API calls
- Local state updates provide immediate feedback
- Background sync handles persistence
- Loading states for long operations

### Image Generation Feedback
**Research**: User experience during AI generation
**Decision**: Immediate feedback with progress indicators
**Rationale**:
- Users need to know generation is in progress
- Estimated completion times based on current queue
- Fallback handling for generation failures
- Version history prevents lost work

### Publishing Performance
**Research**: SEO metadata generation timing
**Decision**: Async publishing with preview capability
**Rationale**:
- Preview generation happens instantly (client-side)
- SEO metadata generated on publish (server-side)
- Caching strategy for published work metadata
- Lazy loading for large work lists

## Security Research

### Content Safety
**Decision**: Multi-layer content filtering
**Rationale**:
- Prompt analysis before AI generation
- User reporting system for published content
- Admin controls for content moderation
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

### User Data Protection
**Decision**: Leverage Supabase RLS and auth
**Rationale**:
- Row Level Security ensures data isolation
- JWT-based authentication with secure sessions
- No sensitive data in client-side storage
- Audit logging for admin actions

### API Security
**Decision**: Supabase edge functions with auth middleware
**Rationale**:
- Server-side validation of all requests
- Rate limiting per authenticated user
- Input sanitization for all text content
- Secure image URL generation

## Scalability Research

### Database Design
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with JSON columns for flexible content
**Rationale**:
- Supabase PostgreSQL handles expected load
- JSON columns for character metadata and enhancement history
- Proper indexing for common queries
- Horizontal scaling available if needed

### Image Storage
**Decision**: Supabase Storage with CDN
**Rationale**:
- Built-in CDN for global image delivery
- Automatic optimization and resizing
- Secure URL generation with expiration
- Cost-effective for expected image volumes

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Browser caching + Supabase query caching
**Rationale**:
- Static assets cached at browser level
- API responses cached appropriately
- Real-time updates where needed (editing)
- Cache invalidation for published content

## Integration Points

### Existing Platform Integration
**Research**: Connection points with current features
**Decisions**:
- Explore page displays published works
- Image generation reuses existing pipeline
- Authentication shares existing user system
- Navigation integrates with current navbar

### Future Extensibility
**Research**: v2 features preparation
**Decisions**:
- Database schema supports future collaboration features
- API design allows for additional export formats
- Component architecture supports advanced editing features
- Analytics foundation enables advanced reporting

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Large text performance**: Debounced saves + textarea optimization
2. **Image generation failures**: Retry mechanism + version history
3. **Publishing edge cases**: Comprehensive validation + rollback capability
4. **User data loss**: Autosave + optimistic updates + conflict resolution

### User Experience Risks
1. **Complex workflow**: Progressive disclosure + guided onboarding
2. **Performance perception**: Loading states + progress indicators
3. **Content loss**: Multiple save strategies + clear feedback
4. **Publishing anxiety**: Preview system + unpublish capability

## Conclusion

All technical decisions align with existing platform architecture while adding minimal complexity. The research validates the feasibility of all 35 functional requirements within the proposed technical approach. No significant technical risks identified that would require architecture changes.
