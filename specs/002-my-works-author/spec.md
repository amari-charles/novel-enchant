## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An author wants to create a multi-chapter fantasy novel with AI-generated images that enhance key scenes. They write chapters by pasting text, use AI to automatically insert images at dramatic moments, manage character consistency across chapters, and publish their completed work for readers to discover and enjoy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an author has an account, **When** they create a new work with title "Dragon's Quest" and description "Epic fantasy adventure", **Then** they should see an empty work ready for chapter addition
2. **Given** an author has a work, **When** they paste 5000 words of text as Chapter 1, **Then** the system should save automatically and show "Last saved: [timestamp]"
3. **Given** an author has text in a chapter, **When** they select "Auto Enhance" mode, **Then** AI should automatically insert 3-5 images at appropriate story moments
4. **Given** an author has enhanced chapters, **When** they add character "Aria the Sorceress" to their character list, **Then** they can link existing images to this character for consistency
5. **Given** an author has completed chapters, **When** they choose "Publish Publicly", **Then** their work should appear on the Explore page with proper SEO metadata
6. **Given** an author has published work, **When** readers view their chapters, **Then** the author should see view counts and unique visitor metrics in their analytics dashboard

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an author pastes text exceeding the soft limit? System should suggest splitting into multiple chapters
- How does the system handle retry attempts for image generation? Previous versions should be preserved but marked as inactive
- What occurs when an author tries to delete a character linked to multiple images? System should warn and allow unlinking or merging with another character
- How does unpublishing work? Work immediately disappears from Explore but analytics data is preserved
