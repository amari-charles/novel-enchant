# Implementation Plan: AI-Powered Story Illustration System

**Branch**: `003-business-context-target` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-business-context-target/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detected React/TypeScript web application with mock AI services
   → Set Structure Decision to web application (frontend existing)
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Mock implementation simplifies architecture
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research frontend integration patterns for AI enhancement
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement AI-powered story illustration system for independent authors. System provides auto-generation of 2-3 images per chapter and manual insertion at cursor positions. Features character registry for consistency, retry/accept mechanisms, and inline image rendering. All AI services are mocked in v1 using deterministic placeholders to validate UX before infrastructure investment.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with React 19.1
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, existing UI component library
**Storage**: Frontend state management (no backend storage for mocked features)
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (existing test setup)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (existing frontend application)
**Project Type**: web - frontend enhancement to existing React application
**Performance Goals**: Instant mock responses, smooth UI interactions, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: No real AI services, deterministic outputs only, existing design system compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user enhancement flow, 3 enhancement modes, character registry UI

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (frontend enhancement to existing React app)
- Using framework directly? Yes (React components, no wrapper abstractions)
- Single data model? Yes (enhancement entities only)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct API calls, no repository layer needed)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes (feature-based modules in existing structure)
- Libraries listed: enhancement-engine (mock AI services), character-registry (character management), anchor-manager (position tracking)
- CLI per library: N/A (frontend components only)
- Library docs: Component documentation following existing patterns

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes (existing test setup supports TDD)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Will follow TDD
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Mock services simulate real behavior patterns
- Integration tests for: component interactions, enhancement flows, character registry
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Console logging for mock service interactions
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (frontend-only feature)
- Error context sufficient? Error boundaries and user-friendly error states

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (initial mock implementation)
- BUILD increments on every change? Following existing versioning
- Breaking changes handled? N/A (new feature addition)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure (existing frontend with new features)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

Research tasks needed:
1. Frontend integration patterns for mock AI services
2. State management for enhancement flows
3. Image positioning and rendering strategies
4. Character consistency UI patterns

**Output**: research.md with integration approaches and UI patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

Design deliverables:
1. **data-model.md**: Enhancement, Character, Anchor, Image entities
2. **contracts/**: Mock service interfaces (auto-enhance, manual-insert, character-resolve)
3. **Contract tests**: Mock service response validation
4. **quickstart.md**: User story validation scenarios
5. **CLAUDE.md**: Update with enhancement feature context

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from enhancement user flows
- Each mock service → interface + implementation task
- Each UI component → component + test task
- Integration flows → end-to-end test task

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before components
- Dependency order: Services before hooks before components
- Feature order: Core enhancement → Character registry → UI integration

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered tasks covering mock services, character management, and UI components

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following TDD principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, UI validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - mock implementation keeps architecture simple*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
