# Quickstart: AI-Powered Story Illustration System

**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Feature**: Enhancement engine validation scenarios

## Prerequisites
- React application running in development mode
- Test chapter with content (minimum 500 characters)
- User authenticated in the application

## User Story Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Auto-Generate Chapter Flow
**Story**: Author wants to automatically enhance chapter with 2-3 illustrations

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to chapter editor for existing chapter
2. Click "Auto Enhance All" button
3. Observe loading state with progress indication
4. Wait for generation to complete (2-3 seconds in mock)
5. Verify 2-3 images appear inline with text
6. Check that images are positioned at logical story points
7. Verify character candidates appear for review if new characters detected
8. Confirm each image has retry/accept buttons in edit mode

**Expected Results**:
- Loading state shows progress
- 2-3 anchors created with images
- Images use picsum.photos placeholder URLs
- Character candidates appear with "Character A/B/C" names
- All images have quality scores (textAlign: 0.8, refSim: 0.7)
- UI switches to enhanced view showing inline images

### Scenario 2: Manual Insert at Cursor Position
**Story**: Author wants to insert image at specific location

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to chapter editor
2. Click in text to position cursor at desired location
3. Right-click to open context menu
4. Select "Insert Image Here"
5. Wait for image generation (1-2 seconds in mock)
6. Verify image appears at exact cursor position
7. Check that text is properly split before/after image
8. Verify image has retry/accept controls

**Expected Results**:
- Context menu appears at cursor position
- Image generates at exact character position
- Text splits cleanly around image
- Position marker shows in image metadata
- Anchor created with stable ID for position

### Scenario 3: Create from Selection
**Story**: Author wants to generate image from highlighted text

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to chapter editor
2. Highlight a text passage (20-100 characters)
3. Right-click to open context menu
4. Select "Create from Selection"
5. Wait for image generation
6. Verify image appears after the selected text
7. Check that prompt includes selected text context
8. Verify image relates to highlighted content

**Expected Results**:
- Selection highlighting visible
- Context menu shows selection option
- Image positioned after selected text
- Prompt metadata includes source text
- Generated image conceptually matches selection

### Scenario 4: Character Management Flow
**Story**: Author wants to review and manage character consistency

**Steps**:
1. Complete auto-enhancement that detects new characters
2. Navigate to character candidates section
3. Review suggested character "Character A"
4. Confirm character with custom name
5. Generate another image mentioning same character
6. Verify visual consistency maintained
7. Test character merging functionality
8. Check character registry updates

**Expected Results**:
- Candidate characters listed with confidence scores
- Author can confirm/ignore/merge candidates
- Confirmed characters appear in registry
- Subsequent images maintain character appearance
- Character aliases work for recognition

### Scenario 5: Retry and Accept Flow
**Story**: Author wants to retry unsatisfactory image

**Steps**:
1. Generate image using any method
2. Hover over image to reveal controls
3. Click "Retry" button
4. Wait for new image generation
5. Compare new image to previous
6. Click "Accept" on satisfactory image
7. Verify image is marked as final
8. Check that retry creates new version

**Expected Results**:
- Retry button visible on hover
- New image replaces previous at same anchor
- Accept button finalizes image selection
- Image metadata shows version history
- UI indicates accepted vs. pending state

### Scenario 6: Error Handling
**Story**: System handles errors gracefully

**Steps**:
1. Attempt to insert image at invalid position (beyond text)
2. Try to enhance very short chapter (<100 characters)
3. Simulate network failure during generation
4. Test rapid clicking of enhancement buttons
5. Verify error messages are user-friendly
6. Check that system recovers from errors

**Expected Results**:
- Position validation prevents invalid anchors
- Short chapters show minimum length warning
- Network errors show retry options
- Rapid actions are debounced
- Error boundaries catch component failures
- User can recover without refresh

## Performance Validation

### Response Times (Mock Implementation)
- Auto-enhance: 2-3 seconds (simulated processing)
- Manual insert: 1-2 seconds (simulated generation)
- Character detection: 0.5-1 seconds
- Retry operations: 1-2 seconds
- UI interactions: <100ms (immediate)

### Resource Usage
- Memory usage stable during multiple enhancements
- No memory leaks from image loading
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive UI during background processing

## Integration Validation

### Existing Features
- Chapter editing continues to work normally
- Save/load functionality preserves enhancements
- Navigation between chapters maintains state
- User authentication remains functional

### Data Persistence
- Enhancement state persists during session
- Anchors maintain stable IDs across operations
- Character registry updates correctly
- Image associations remain intact

## Error Scenarios

### Input Validation
- Empty chapter text → Warning message
- Invalid cursor position → Position adjustment
- Malformed character data → Error recovery
- Missing required fields → User-friendly prompts

### Network Simulation
- Slow responses → Loading states
- Timeout conditions → Retry options
- Service unavailable → Graceful degradation
- Partial failures → Rollback mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### Core Generation (FR-001 to FR-005)
- ✓ Auto-generate 2-3 illustrations per chapter
- ✓ Manual insertion at cursor positions
- ✓ Generation from text selections
- ✓ Inline image placement
- ✓ Stable anchor point maintenance

### Character Management (FR-006 to FR-010)

## Success Metrics Validation

### Quantitative Measures
- Enhancement completion rate: >95%

- Character management is straightforward
- Error messages are helpful and actionable
- Overall experience encourages continued use

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Images not appearing**: Check anchor creation and position validation
2. **Character detection failed**: Verify text content and existing character data
3. **Positioning errors**: Validate cursor position and text length
4. **Performance slow**: Check for memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders
5. **State inconsistencies**: Verify context updates and reducer actions
