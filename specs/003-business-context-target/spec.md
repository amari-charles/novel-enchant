# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Story Illustration System

**Feature Branch**: `003-business-context-target`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Business Context - AI-powered story illustration for independent authors"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: authors (actors), illustration generation (actions), chapters/images/characters (data), mock-only constraint
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clearly specified in functional overview
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows defined for auto-generate and manual insert
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Requirements extracted from acceptance criteria
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Work, Chapter, Character, Anchor, Image entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details present (mock-only constraint)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an independent author, I want to automatically enhance my chapters with AI-generated illustrations that maintain character consistency, so my stories become more immersive and visually appealing to readers without requiring artistic skills or large budgets.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Auto-Generate Chapter Flow
1. **Given** an author has a chapter with text content, **When** they click "Auto Enhance All", **Then** the system generates 2-3 illustrations at appropriate story points with consistent character representations
2. **Given** a chapter has existing characters mentioned, **When** auto-generation runs, **Then** the system recognizes these characters and maintains their visual consistency
3. **Given** new character mentions are found during auto-generation, **When** the process completes, **Then** the system creates candidate characters for author review

#### Manual Insert Flow
1. **Given** an author places their cursor at a specific position in text, **When** they select "Insert Image Here", **Then** an illustration is created at that exact position
2. **Given** an author highlights a text passage, **When** they select "Create from Selection", **Then** an illustration is generated based on that passage and placed after the selection
3. **Given** an author wants to use existing characters, **When** they select characters during manual insert, **Then** the generated image includes those specific characters

#### Character Management
1. **Given** the system detects a potential new character, **When** presented as a candidate, **Then** the author can confirm, ignore, or merge with existing character
2. **Given** confirmed characters exist in the registry, **When** generating new images, **Then** visual consistency is maintained across all appearances

### Edge Cases
- What happens when cursor position is out of bounds? ’ System returns error message
- How does system handle when no characters are detected? ’ Proceeds with scene-only illustration
- What happens when retry is requested at existing anchor? ’ Anchor ID is reused but image is replaced
- How does system handle empty or very short chapters? ’ Minimum text length required for auto-generation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Generation
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authors to auto-generate 2-3 illustrations per chapter
- **FR-002**: System MUST support manual image insertion at specific cursor positions
- **FR-003**: System MUST support image generation from highlighted text selections
- **FR-004**: Images MUST be inserted inline with text at appropriate positions
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain stable anchor points (same position always = same anchor ID)

#### Character Management
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect and track character mentions across chapters
- **FR-007**: System MUST propose candidate characters when new entities are detected
- **FR-008**: Authors MUST be able to confirm, ignore, or merge candidate characters
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain visual consistency for confirmed characters
- **FR-010**: System MUST support character aliases for recognition

#### User Control
- **FR-011**: Authors MUST be able to retry image generation at any anchor
- **FR-012**: Authors MUST be able to accept or reject generated images
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide three insertion modes: existing characters, new characters, auto-detect
- **FR-014**: Authors MUST be able to review and edit character registry

#### Content Management
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve text content integrity during enhancement
- **FR-016**: Enhanced chapters MUST be publishable to Explore page
- **FR-017**: System MUST track enhancement metrics (images per chapter, retry rates)
- **FR-018**: Images MUST enhance readability without disrupting text flow

#### Mock Constraints (v1)
- **FR-019**: All images MUST use placeholder URLs (picsum.photos) in v1
- **FR-020**: Character names MUST default to "Character A/B/C" format in v1
- **FR-021**: Prompts MUST return static mock strings in v1
- **FR-022**: Consistency scorer MUST always return "ok" verdict in v1

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Work**: Represents an author's complete story/novel with title and optional style preferences
- **Chapter**: Individual chapter within a work containing text content and optional title
- **Character**: Named entity in the story with description, status (candidate/confirmed/ignored/merged), and aliases
- **Anchor**: Stable position marker in chapter text where images can be attached
- **Image**: Generated illustration linked to an anchor with URL and quality scores
- **Prompt**: Text description used to generate an image, with character references and metadata

## Business Context & Success Metrics

### Target Users
- Independent authors
- Web novelists
- Fan-fiction writers

### Problems Solved
- Manual illustration is time-consuming and requires artistic skills
- Current AI tools don't maintain character consistency across images
- Authors need balance between automation speed and creative control

### Success Metrics
- Percentage of chapters enhanced with at least one image
- Retry/approval rates (lower retry rate indicates better initial quality)
- Time reduction from draft to published enhanced chapter
- Higher reader engagement (views/reads per enhanced chapter)

### Scope Boundaries

#### Included in v1
- Author self-enhancement of own chapters
- Publishing enhanced chapters to Explore page
- Character registry and consistency tracking
- Both auto and manual insertion modes

#### Excluded from v1
- Real AI image generation (mock only)
- Collaboration features
- Reader comments
- Monetization/paywalls
- File uploads or URL imports
- Advanced layouts beyond inline images

### Risks & Assumptions
- Risk: Image quality/consistency may frustrate authors
- Risk: Generation costs may exceed plan limits (deferred to future)
- Assumption: Authors will accept "consistent-ish" results if workflow is smooth
- Assumption: Mock implementation is sufficient to validate UX before infrastructure investment
